Modular Home AR Tabletop

An AR Foundation project visualizing sustainable modular home construction — created for the TerraLux Dubai Fundraiser Event.

🌍 Overview

This Unity project brings to life a tabletop augmented reality experience showcasing the step-by-step assembly of modular homes designed for sustainable, regenerative living.

Built with AR Foundation, it allows users to view, rotate, and interact with a 3D model representing real-world modular home installations — projected onto a physical surface such as a white event table or scaled model.

The project is part of a fundraising initiative in Dubai, demonstrating innovative, eco-driven architecture and immersive storytelling through technology.

✨ Core Features

Interactive AR Tabletop Visualization
View modular home units assembling in real time with clean transitions and spatial awareness.

Cross-Platform Compatibility
Works on both iOS (ARKit) and Android (ARCore) devices using Unity’s AR Foundation.

Sustainable Architecture Demo
The models represent scalable, energy-efficient living modules inspired by desert and bioregional design principles.

Fundraiser Showcase Mode
Optimized for exhibition presentation — smooth animations, guided sequence, and optional voiceover or HUD captions.
